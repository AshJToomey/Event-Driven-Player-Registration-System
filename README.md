# âš½ Event-Driven Player Registration System

This is a simple Python project demonstrating **event-driven architecture** using custom event registration and dispatching. It models a football environment where a player is registered, triggering notifications to teammates and sending a message automatically.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- **Event-Driven Programming**: Code responds to events (e.g., `player_registered`) by executing associated handler functions.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Logic is organized into multiple files (`main.py`, `functions.py`, `event_systems.py`) for clarity and scalability.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

event_systems_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py # Core logic to register a player and dispatch events
â”œâ”€â”€ functions.py # Functions triggered by events (e.g., notify, send message)
â”œâ”€â”€ event_systems.py # Custom event system to register and handle events
â””â”€â”€ README.md # Project overview and instructions


## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py

You should see output showing the player being saved and both event handlers responding.

ðŸ›  Example Output
Player was saved Ashley 100
message sent Ashley
Teammates were notified Ashley
